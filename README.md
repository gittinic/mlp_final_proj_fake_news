(Abstract) The spread of false news on social media platforms continues to concern many. Various methods have been applied to classify veracity of twitter content. Assessing  the veracity of tweets based on measures of information diffusion using a hybrid neural network is a novel approach to distinguish false and true news. The model has been trained and tested on 42,081 tweet cascades. The results show that it is possible to predict veracity based on measures of information diffusion to some extent. Yet, further research is advised to increase the model's performance.
